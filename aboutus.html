            <p>Our mission at Bored Games is providing honest opinions and detailed tutorials with sincerity, pride and originality.</p>
            <p>We originally started the website in 2014 in order to review board games and tabletop rpg's along with our youtube channel.
            We are a group of 4 friends from various backgrounds who met during highschool, readers of our content know us by know but we are Matt, Alejandro, Franklin, and Andres.
            The website and youtube channel started as a fun hobby for us to keep trying new board games and to have a schedule to meet up and hang out.
            This idea that started as a hobby has evolved and become a passion.

            <p>The channel focuses on tutorials and playthroughs of board games as well as a weekly tabletop rpg game with the Bored Games crew.
            The website has evolved as you see it now, over the years we've managed to bring more content and advertisement and partnerships to extend the functoniality of our website to include a store.
            We are very appreciative with all of the support we've received and we want our community to know we work hard everyday to make original and sincere content.
