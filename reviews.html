        Come one come all thrill seeking adventurers and settle the lands of Catan!
        <br></br>
        Gather your friends and fight over land in this award winning strategy game. The game is meant for 3-4 players played on a hexagonal board made up of hexagonal tiles, 
        the board can be setup differently and randomly with each new playthrough with a total of over 200 billion board combinations. Between the strategy and the simplicity of the rules Catan 
        is an extremely replayable board game and a great choice for people just starting out in the board game world. <a href="catanreview.html"> Read more </a>

        The east wind blows across europe. Sinister things are at work during the dark hours of the night, whispers of Dracula come back from the dead!
        <br></br>
        Gather your friends and escape from them while increasing influence and creating chaos across 1898 Europe. The game is for 2-5 players which features one antagonist player as Dracula 
        and four other players as his hunters. Definitely a complex and intriguing strategy game where there are two different sets of objectives. Either as Dracula to spread your influence and evade 
        or defeat the tenacious hunters, or as the hunters to track down the elusive vampire and kill him before he can have Europe in his grasp. Recommended for intermediate 
        players of the board game world, Fury of Dracula features several different actions spanning accross day and night cycles, highly replayable with each individual 
        character bringing a unique set of skills to the game. <a href="furyofdraculareview.html"> Read more </a>

        Hope you're hungry because we have a full plater for the whole group!
        <br></br>
        Gather your friends and enjoy these delicacies as you fight to gain control of more points. This party game allows 2-8 players and several different menu combinations to spice 
        up that gameplay! A number of cards are drawn from the deck and starting with one player each person picks one of the cards in the hand and pass the hand down to the next person 
        until there is no more cards left and then score the points for that round. There are three rounds, so even if you're behind in any of the rounds there is still plenty of time to 
        catch up to your friends. With just a few minutes you can learn the game and play it! with the very simplistic action you take all you need to worry about is the strategy and your 
        hungy friends. Very replayable and extremely beginner friendly. <a href="sushigopartyreview.html"> Read more </a>
